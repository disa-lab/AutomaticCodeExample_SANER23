# Documentation-Specific Code Example Generation
We employed pre-trained GPT-3 model (Codex) for documentation-specific code example generation using different contexts (i.e., source code, documentation, and error logs) as input. 

# Data
We primarily used 40 python functions randomly selected from the scikit-learn library for this study. The excel file (generated_and_corrected_code_examples.xlsx) contains the method list and the generated code examples.

# Code
All codes are shared in the "codes" directory in a sequential manner.
